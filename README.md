**DESCRIPTION OF TASK** : The task involves building a predictive machine learning model using scikit-learn to classify or predict outcomes (e.g., spam email detection). Deliverables include a Jupyter Notebook showcasing the model's implementation, dataset preprocessing, training, and evaluation with metrics and visualizations like a confusion matrix.

# Machine Learning Model for Spam Email Detection

## Overview

This project implements a predictive machine learning model using **scikit-learn** to classify and predict outcomes from a dataset. Specifically, this implementation focuses on **spam email detection**, where the goal is to classify emails as either "spam" or "ham" (not spam).

## Objective

- **Dataset**: The project uses a dataset with labeled emails (spam/ham) to train the model.
- **Model Implementation**: We implement and evaluate a machine learning model to classify spam emails using algorithms like Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, or Support Vector Machine (SVM).
- **Evaluation**: The model is evaluated based on its accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Requirements

- `scikit-learn`: For model implementation.
- `pandas`: For data handling.
- `numpy`: For numerical operations.
- `matplotlib`: For visualization.
- `seaborn`: For more advanced visualizations.

To install these libraries, run:

```bash
pip install scikit-learn pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
